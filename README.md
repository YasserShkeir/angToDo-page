# AngToDo; A ToDo App using Angular CLI, Tailwind CSS, and ghpages

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4, styled using Tailwind CSS, and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## App Usage

You can add a ToDo, which contains a name, time of start and time of ending. ToDos can be marked as done or removed by user.

## Additional Features

The data is stored locally using JSON format, this means that even if you refresh, close the web app, restart pc, etc... your ToDos will stay there.

Additionally, the Google Calendar Icon should take you to said Calendar to add the ToDo in there. (Yet to be added)
